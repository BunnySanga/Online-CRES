# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Setup

5. Import the SQL schema from `DB.sql` into your MySQL instance.
6. Start backend and frontend as described below.

### OTP schema migration (admins can reset passwords)

If you previously created the database using an older `DB.sql`, the `OTP` table referenced only `Student(student_id)`. To support admin password resets, the `OTP` table is now polymorphic with columns `(user_id, user_role)`.

- For a fresh setup, nothing extra is needed.
- For an existing DB, run the migration SQL in `backend/migrations/2025-10-20_polymorphic_otp.sql`. This will drop and re-create the `OTP` table. If you need to preserve historical OTPs, create a backup first as indicated in the migration file.
